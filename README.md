# CurrencyAutomationTask:
 Write an acceptance test for http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/
 The Acceptance criteria is to test multiple conversion rates
 The test should iterate over 5 sets of sample data.
 Example iteration :
o The test should input from Euro to pounds.
o Verify the result on the proceeding page.

The Test can be done in the JVM Stack with Java or any JVM language of your choice or build tool of
your choice, Gradle or other.
IDE Tools:

o Eclipse. https://www.eclipse.org/
o IntelliJ IDE. https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/
o Netbeans. https://netbeans.org/
o Others.

The Java solution should consist of ;
 Install Java 8 :
o http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-
2133151.html
 Install Maven 3.3.X + :
o https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
 Unit Framework :
o TestNG
 http://testng.org/doc/
o Junit
 https://junit.org/junit5/

 Maven Central :
o Use maven central for locating dependences.
 https://search.maven.org/

 Running the test from the maven build tool.
o Setting up a maven pom.xml in;
 Eclipse
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNEcpw8LPpo
 Intellij
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt3uB0sd5kY
 Netbeans –
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sY26GtnS57I

o Set name/package of project module –
 https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-naming-conventions.html
o Include Dependences for solution
 Sample : https://spring.io/guides/gs/maven/
 Include Selenium Dependenceys.
o Use a test scope;
 Sample : https://spring.io/guides/gs/maven/
o In maven Java Plugin and set to 1.8
 https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-compiler-plugin/examples/set-
compiler-source-and-target.html

o Include a build profile
 http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-profiles.html

 Reports
o Location to Generated reports should be included in readme file.

 Unit framework junit or testNG can be used.
 Assertions should be used for verification.
 A “readme.txt” file to tell the user how to build and execute solution.
 The Selenium Test can use the following webdrivers, chrome, firefox and IE.

 Optional: add reporting framework, Allure, Serenity, other
o Allure - https://github.com/allure-framework/allure1/wiki/Steps
o Serenity - http://thucydides.info/docs/serenity-staging/

Outcome:
The test execution should be documented in the readme file and tell the user how to run the
Selenium based test and look for the Unit result.
This task should be completed within 48 hrs from which it was mailed.
A phone call will proceed this to talk through the solution.
